## HTML/CSS &  Vanilla JS  

```
 > git clone https://github.com/IgorStetsiuk/GridU-HTMLCSS.git
 > cd GridU-HTMLCSS
 > npm install
 > npm run dev
 > go to /src/components/pages/
```

All compiled scss will ended up at **compile** folder

    Note:
    Pages aren't linked. Need to go to specific page in a folder `pages` and open in browser
    There isn't dev server
